# vbspt-optimizations
Optimization efforts for the vbSPT software for the Master's thesis "High Performance Computing aspects of Single Particle Machine Learning" written during the Spring of 2015 by Marcus NÃ¤slund.

There are seven files present:
* **VB3_VBEMiterator.m**: The most optimized version of the EM algorithm.
* **VB3_preprocess.m**: The new version of the preprocessing algorithm. Can be parallelized if necessary.
* **HMM_multiForwardBackward.c**: An optimized version of the FB algorithm with no functional changes. 
* **HMM_multiForwardBackward_openmp.c**: A version of the FB algorithm parallelized using OpenMP. Remember to turn off the parallelization in MATLAB before using this.
* **HMM_multiForwardBackward_blas.c**: A version of the FB algorithm using BLAS routines. Remember to use the VB3_VBEMiterator_blas.m and VB3_preprocess_blas.m instead of the original files, so that data is ordered in the correct way.
* **VB3_VBEMiterator_blas.m**: See above.
* **VB3_preprocess_blas.m**: See above.

For details on performance please read the thesis report (link coming in June).
